# API 

Simple API to communicate with DB and youtube api. Analyzing comments using calls to `bert-model` api, as I wanted to check what it's `micro-services` are (or just tried, don't take it as if I don't know what I am talking about)

Using pyenv, as tensorflow doesn't have stable version for python version > 3.10.9
