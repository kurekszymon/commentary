# Project

This project was my another take on becoming rich and famous, and it did fail like many others. However this time I think it was different as I was able to try to reach out to some customers (first time lol, felt nice). 

The problem was that as the project was targeted for polish youtubers (as model is now trained only for polish language, as I thought that there's a niche for that), and they are not bothered with using this solution. I am not mad or surprised by any means, just stating the fact. 

I learned so much doing this project that I know the next one will be better. 
- I revised `python` and `flask` as both [backend](backend/README.md) and [model](bert-model/README.md) are using this tools.
- Reaserched, developed and trained ML model to evaluate sentiment for polish language. 
- Did my part on frontend side using `React`, `Typescript` and [Svelte](bert-model/data/evaluation/frontend/README.md) (miniproject for easier comments evaluation)
- Learned some `docker` and how models and `networking works in containers`
- Learned some `nginx` to properly host a site.
- **First time hosted app on my own machine** (as a service on `linode.com`)
- **First time reached out to potential customers**
- and much more

I don't consider it a failure or waste of time. I had a great time and learned much more than I expected. 
Now I will just think on a better idea.
